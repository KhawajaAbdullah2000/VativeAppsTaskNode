Advantages of worker threads are that the cpu intensive tasks are directed to worker threads reducing the load on the main thread to handle incomming requests. 
Our Application can handle more concurrent users without significant degradation in performance by distributing the load across multiple worker threads.
One disadvantage is that when using worker threads, it adds complexity to the codebase, requiring additional error handling and communication mechanisms between threads.
